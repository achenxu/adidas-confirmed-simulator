# Adidas Confirmed simulator (JavaScript)
Demo: http://tools.yzy.io/adidas-confirmed-simulator/

### About
Quick project I made, because I wanted to test my tap speed on mobile devices.
There wasn't an easy to use solution available to just test my taps. The button is centered horizontally and vertically, just like the Adidas application.
